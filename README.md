# Three-Phase-AC-Voltage-Controller
For the Simulation of a Three Phase AC Voltage Controller with  on RL Load. A MATLAB Simulink model created with a 311V , 50 Hz , Three phase programmable volate source connected to 6 thyristors, whose gate ports are connected to 6 seperate pulse generators with the details defined in the simulink model. The output from the thyristors are connected to a RL load. The output RMS and input RMS values are calculated and Efficiency of the output along with the Totla Harmonic Distortion is displayed for the Performance of the AC VOltage Controller.
